# CLUSTERING-AND-FITTING_2
This task aims at investigating and comparing the house price dataset in California. There are quite a few features as available in the dataset like the geographical coordinates, characteristics of housing, and income median. The goal is to use exploratory data analysis (EDA), K-means clustering, and linear regression to understand housing trends and forecast the median house prices given the income levels. Furthermore, the study has used appropriate visualizations to identify the relationship of the variables and measure the effectiveness of the model based on  appropriate figures.
